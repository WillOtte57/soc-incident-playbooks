# SOC Incident Response Playbooks

This repository contains beginner-friendly incident response playbooks for common security events that a SOC (Security Operations Center) might handle.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice thinking like a SOC analyst
- Break down security incidents into clear, repeatable steps
- Document investigation, containment, and recovery actions

## Included Playbooks

- Phishing Email Investigation
- Brute Force Login Attempt
- Malware on a Workstation (coming soon)

Each playbook is written in simple, step-by-step language so it is easy to follow for someone new to cybersecurity.

## How to Use

- Open a playbook file in this repository.
- Follow the steps in order: Detection → Analysis → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned.
- Use these as study material for SOC workflows and the CompTIA Security+ exam.

This project is part of my learning journey toward becoming a SOC analyst.
